# work-day-planner

**This is a work day planner that allows you to schedule events/activities over 1-hour blocks during the current day. 

**Functionality includes:**
1. Selecting a one-hour block during the day between the hours of 9:00 am and 5:00 pm.
2. Writing an event text/description into a modal.
3. Saving that content written to the time block selected.
4. Displaying that event saved in the time block along with any other scheduled events until the browser is closed.

And VOILA!
